# Phase-1-Project - Where To?

'Where To?' is a website that allows a user to view various location options for their next vacation. The website allows for the addition and removal of destinations from the page, while also allowing editing, rating, and reviewing of all locations.

# Usage

To begin using the website, load the HTML file in your browser, and run the following command to start your server:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json --routes routes.json
```

To revert the database to its original state, copy the information from dbBackup.json to db.json.
